If someone you know is struggling emotionally or having a hard time,  you can be the difference in getting them the help they need. It’s important to take care of yourself when you are supporting someone through a difficult time, as this may stir up difficult emotions. If it does, please reach out for support yourself.  The cumulative impacts in our daily efforts to reduce stigma, challenge stereotypes, and spread awareness of suicide and its devastating impact can make a difference in people's lives.

# Scaled resources for all concerns

## International Frontline services
Anyone can hit crisis point. [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net/about-calm/what-is-calm/) runs a [free and confidential helpline and webchat](https://www.thecalmzone.net/help/get-help/) – 7 hours a day, 7 days a week for anyone who needs to talk about life’s problems. We support those bereaved by suicide, through the [Support After Suicide Partnership (SASP)](http://supportaftersuicide.org.uk/).

## LGBTQ community lifeline
If you are a member of the LGBTQ community and need to talk to a trained counselor, use the Trevor Project's TrevorLifeLines 24/7" 1-866-488-7386.

## Hackweek community workplace 
We opened a new workspace in the Waterhack Circle on Qiqochat. [In the Big Lake, there is a CALM room](https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/garden/1). This is an experimental workplace environment for doing all the things we know need to be done at work, and for talking about the data and facts about all the things that get in the way of working. While we focus on individual tasks, we are exploring how to accomplish our work with questions such as: What can I do when I can focus on work, while at work? What can I complete when undisrupted by common workplace stressors? What can I do next to maintain a healthy nervous system for generating new ideas? Ask [Canary Opera about access to the private CALM Github repository](https://github.com/canaryopera) and more resources.

## United States 
If you or someone you know is in crisis, you can also use the [National Suicide Prevention Lifelife](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-someone-else/). Never keep it a secret if a friend tells you about a plan to hurt themselves. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) so that you can find out what resources are available in your area, or encourage your loved one to call. Calls are routed to the Lifeline center closest to your area code that can provide you with local resources.

# Warning Signs
Not everyone will give their friends and loved ones verbal hints about their suicidal thoughts. That's why it's important to recognize warning signs in actions as well as words.

Be wary if you, your loved one, friend, or colleague:
- Begins to search online for ways to kill themselves, such as buying a gun or obtaining medical prescriptions
- Increases their use of alcohol or drugs
- Sleeps too much or too little
- Starts to behave recklessly, such as driving while intoxicated or without a seat belt
- Appears agitated, expresses rage or talks about seeking revenge
- Has extreme mood swings, from euphoria to the depths of depression
- Appears to feel hopeless or talks about feeling trapped or having no reason to live
- Appears to be in unbearable psychological pain or talks about being a burden to friends or family
- Withdraws or isolates from others
