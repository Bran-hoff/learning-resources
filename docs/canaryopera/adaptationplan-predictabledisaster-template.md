## Community Impacted and Disaster management plan for mental health.  

Step 1: Identify a crisis therapist/counselor/professional.  

Step 2: Draft a Response Plan:  Leadership will meet with the professional for one hour as soon as possible after a crisis.  This  professional will facilitate notifications and communications and the first meeting after the crisis. Offer mental health appointments to people in the group with multiple accessible options before getting back to regular work meetings. Have other therapists/counselors/professionals available to backup the team, or if support needs to be tailored.  

Step 3: Preparedness Activities should stay realistic about risks, research and common challenges, as well as up to date, and educational.  Update the response plan and resource links every six months; review the process and update to fill gaps as members join and leave the research group.  Provide useful resources on daily, weekly, monthly strategies to measure 'OK' and 'Not OK', normalize a culture of balancing privacy, consent, and skills for best practice responses to concerns, stigma, and trauma that interrupt everyday bias.  Provide information and HR introductions for where to get support on health insurance logistics and no-cost services for mental health and family medical leave.

Note 1: Only well resourced people with experience using counseling resources or therapists would feel comfortable making use of typical university resources -- without more education. It is unfortunately common but normal for an expert in one area not to get the help they need in an area of expertise outside of their comfort zone. 

Note 2: Blind optimism is not a mental health strategy. Everyday plans have cumulative impacts if they occur in advance of a crisis.  Problem solving in a crisis to address emotions is avoidance and denial, not a plan.  When crisis and emotions are high, listening and checking in on levels of support are the most helpful. 

Note 3: Ongoing stress, repeat work bias and trauma, and elevated social, economic, and environmental pressures may generate long-running crises on the time scale of activities such as acquiring a PhD, securing a permanent job, raising a family, or recovering from a global pandemic.  Put on your own oxygen mask first, do your own self work, and spend time educating yourself about best practices for issues that are emerging or new to you.  Self awareness and personal education is something you can do NOW to avoid participating in or contributing to triggering mental health disaster and crisis events in the future.
