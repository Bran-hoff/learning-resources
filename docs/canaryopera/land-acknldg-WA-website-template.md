# Land Acknowledgement Tutorial 

As an example: [Nooksack Temperature Lapse Rate Study 2016-2018 is a hydroshare resource](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/222e832d3df24dea9bae9bbeb6f4219d/) where we don't quite know where to put the land acknowledgement - we put it at the end of the abstract.  We put it in the 'Additional Metadata'.  There is a license and related resource that links to the [Github repository the tribe owns](https://github.com/nooksack-indian-tribe/CurvyLapseRate), and there is a repository with a readme.md with the Land Acknowledgement repeated.  But it is not yet clear that there is a 'right place' or a way to distinguish or verify that the Tribal Council knows about this resource that is easy to find.

[Land Acknowledgement in Github](https://github.com/nooksack-indian-tribe/CurvyLapseRate): The Coast Salish people are the indigenous inhabitants of Western Washington. The Nooksack Watershed, from the peak of Mount Baker to the Bellingham Bay, is the unceded ancestral land of the Nooksack Tribe and Lummi Nation. They are still here, continuing to honor and bring to light their ancient heritage. The University of Washington acknowledges the Coast Salish peoples of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip and Muckleshoot nations.

Land Acknowledgement in pending NSF Proposal: The land that surrounds us is part of who we are; it reflects our histories. The Tribes of the Salish Sea traveled over mountains to gather food, with homelands in the foothills of the North Cascades, known as canoe people of the Sauk, Suiattle, Stillaguamish, Cascade, Skagit and Snohomish Rivers. We protect and honor the history and people of these places. The University of Washington acknowledges the Coast Salish peoples of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip and Muckleshoot nations. The Treaty of Point Elliott was signed in 1855 in Mukilteo, Washington, where the territory was relinquished to the United States, including all their right, title, and interest in and to the lands and country occupied by them, in exchange for total sum of $150,000 and the right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations, which was further secured in common with all citizens of the Territory.
