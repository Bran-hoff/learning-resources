# Land Acknowledgement Tutorial 

As an example: Nooksack Temperature Lapse Rate Study 2016-2018  is a hydroshare resource where we don't quite know where to put the land acknowledgement - we put it at the end of the abstract.  We put it in the 'Additional Metadata'.  There is a license and related resource that links to the Github repository the tribe owns, and there is a repository with a readme.md with the Land Acknowledgement repeated.  But I don't know that there is a 'right place' or a way to distinguish or verify that the Tribal Council knows about this resource that is easy to find.
