**Interdependence of Science, Engineering, and Technology**

MS-LS1-1. Conduct an investigation to provide evidence  
MS-LS1-2.	Develop and use a model to describe a function or process
MS-LS1-3.	Use argument supported by evidence
MS-LS1-8. Gather and synthesize information

?? How does this connect to computer systems and groups of human systems ??

Engineering advances have led to important discoveries in virtually every field of science, and scientific discoveries have led to the development of entire industries and engineered systems. (MS-LS1-1)


Use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the conceptual understanding that cells form tissues and tissues form organs specialized for particular body functions. Examples could include the interaction of subsystems within a system and the normal functioning of those systems.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the mechanism of one body system independent of others. Assessment is limited to the circulatory, excretory, digestive, respiratory, muscular, and nervous systems.]
