# How to Contribute

## Contribute lessons or content

Refer the [Vocabulary and Acronyms](https://waterhackweek.github.io/learning-resources/VocabAcronyms2020) lesson on the sidebar. This document lists some of the terms encountered during the Cyberseminar series. Enrich this vocabulary by contributing to it so that it is up to date and useful for you!!! Add more terms to this document by raising a pull request for the corresponding github project.

Steps:

1. Navigate to the [learning-resources](https://github.com/waterhackweek/learning-resources) Github project
<!-- Place this tag where you want the button to render. -->
2. Click on <a class="github-button" data-icon="octicon-repo-forked" aria-label="Fork ntkme/github-buttons on GitHub">Fork</a> button, present at the right side top. This will create an exact copy of the repository under your Github username
3. Navigate to the forked repository in your profile. It should look something like your-github-username/learning-resources
4. Modify the docs/VocabAcronyms2020.md file by adding your favourite terms to it!
5. On the home page of the forked repository, click on the "New Pull Request" button, this would lead to a page showing changes in your forked repository (your-github-username/learning-resources) and waterhackweek/learning-resources. Review the changes
6. Click on the 'Create Pull Request' button
7. This would redirect you to a template, where you need to describe the changes in your Pull request. Mention the title and description of the change and click on 'Create Pull Request' button.
8. Post this, you just have to wait and watch! If your pull request gets approved, then Congratulations! you made a contribution to open source :D
  

We are extending an open invitation to anyone to join the COVID-19 Community Project experimenting with GeoHealth project integration to contribute and visualize data to Flatten the Curve March 23 - April 16. More information on this will be available soon.

## Extended and updated notes for site development and updates

For details, see the [README file](https://github.com/waterhackweek/learning-resources/blob/master/README.md) on the Waterhackweek learning resources GitHub repository, [https://github.com/waterhackweek/learning-resources/](https://github.com/waterhackweek/learning-resources/).

### Contributing single-page edits

The easiest way to contribute additions or changes to an existing Learning Resources page, like the Vocabulary and Acronyms page, is to go to the page at the web site itself (not the GitHub repository markdown file): [https://waterhackweek.github.io/learning-resources/VocabAcronyms2020/](https://waterhackweek.github.io/learning-resources/VocabAcronyms2020/). That way you can first read it exactly as intended, plus you can find it easily if you start at the Learning Resources home page. Then click on the "Edit on GitHub" link at the upper right, and edit away. A Pull Request will be generated that will be reviewed by us before "merging" it (your changes) into the repository or asking for clarifications.
