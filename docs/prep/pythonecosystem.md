## From Jupyter Book

https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/jupyter.html#essential-python-libraries

Among the vast number of packages in the Python ecosystem, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pandas are among the most commonly used. A good resource for getting familiar with these libraries is the Scipy Lecture Notes https://scipy-lectures.org/.

- Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) is a fundamental library for numerical and scientific computing with Python. It contains data structures for numerical arrays, tools for linear algebra, random number capabilities, and much more.
- SciPy (https://docs.scipy.org/) offers a varied set of functions for scientific computing, such as optimization, interpolation, statistics and signal processing. It also includes fundamental constants from many disciplines such as the speed of light as well as data structures for sparse matrices.
- Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) is the core plotting library for Python and can be used inline in the notebook with the %matplotlib notebook or %matplotlib inline cell magics.
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) provides resources for data analysis and a flexible data structures for labeled tabular data.
