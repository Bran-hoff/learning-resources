# Overview of Logistics

## QiqoChat

Waterhackweek will rely on [QiqoChat](https://qiqochat.com) as our virtual platform for the week. QiqoChat is a wrapper for Zoom (and other applications) that allows us to create detailed calendar events and manage video breakout rooms.

Get started on the Waterhackweek QiqoChat by going to [https://waterhack.qiqochat.com](https://waterhack.qiqochat.com) and creating your profile!

- Make sure to add a profile picture!
- Add your skills: Red for skills you want to learn, yellow for skills you have, and green for skills you can teach.
- Check out the Member directory to visualize our cohort and our skillsets.

Within the main Waterhack QiqoChat "circle", we can collaborate and meet online year-round through different events. Check out the events page, [https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/events](https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/events). You can easily convert your calendar events to your time zone on this page.

Waterhackweek 2020 activities will take place within the Waterhackweek 2020 event.

## Time, Schedule

Waterhackweek 2020 will take place online daily, during the period 8am-4pm PDT / 11am-7pm EDT / 15:00-23:00 UTC August 31 - September 4.
