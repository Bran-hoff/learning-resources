Qiqochat: Our Virtual Platform

Qiqochat will be our virtual platform for the week. Qiqochat is a wrapper for Zoom that allows us to create detailed calendar events and manage video breakout rooms.

Get started on Qiqochat by going to https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/ and create your profile! 

    Make sure to add a profile picture!
    Add your skills: Red for skills you want to learn, yellow for skills you have, and green for skills you can teach.
        Check out the Member directory to visualize our cohort and our skillsets.

Within the main Waterhack circle, we can collaborate and meet online year-round through different events. Check out the events page: https://waterhack.qiqochat.com/events. You can easily convert your calendar events to your time zone on this page.

Waterhackweek 2020 activities will take place within the Waterhackweek 2020 event 



## Time

OceanHackWeek 2020 will take place **online** daily, during the period 11am-2pm PDT / 2pm-5pm EDT / 18:00-21:00 UTC on August 10-14. Tutorials will cover data science topics, followed by project hacking in the afternoon. [Pre-hackweek OPTIONAL activities](../schedule.md#pre-hackweek-optional-tutorials) will be on August 6-7. See [Tutorial schedule](../schedule.md#tutorials) for details.

## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *oceanhkw@uw.edu*.

[go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
